			My family
		</h1>	
		<p>I have two loving parents, Richard and Nancy Elias. They both work in Gardner, Maine. They support me through everything, being the president of boosters for my basketball team throughout high school. They came to all of my sporting events and have always been on my back about my academics. I also have an older brother that studies for his masters at Harvard University and also works there in admissions. 			</p>
