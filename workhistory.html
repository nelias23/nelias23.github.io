			<h2> Ted's Fried Clams</h2>
			<p> I was a prep cook and grill cook at a fried clams restaurant, it was my job to prep all of the seafood for the fryer by covering it in flour, I also cooked many items on the grill (burgers, hotdogs, steak n cheese). Very strenuous, fast paced work, it was very hard but I loved it, although I eventually left Teds to become the head night cook at Shapleigh corner store. </p>

			<h2> Shapleigh Corner Store </h2>
			<p>I worked as a grill cook, fry cook, and pizza cook at Shapleigh Corner store, a pizza and burger restaurant. I first worked here while working at teds, but took my bosses 5 night a week schedule when he left, I worked alone a lot of the time. I stocked supplies, took down notes on what to order, cooked all the food, took take-out orders, and put out food. I have also trained many people and was always looked up to as someone to ask when in need of help. This has definatley been my favorite job, I have had many great learning opportunities and met many great people. </p>
