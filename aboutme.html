				A little about myself
		</h2>	
			<p> What can I say about myself? I grew up in a small town in Waterville, Maine. After graduating high school, my family and I moved to Portland, also in Maine, and have lived there since. I live on the lake at my camp in Belgrade, Maine during the summer. I have a brother and two great parents.   </p>
			<h2>Things I like to do
			</h2>
			<p> A few things I take interests in include; hiking with friends, playing basketball with friends and listening to music and just kicking back with people I'm close to. I also enjoy going out in the Old Port, which is the downtown area in Portland, for beer and food tasting. I recently started looking into stock trading and enjoy exploring new marketing ideas as well. In the summertime I work landscaping and actually enjoy it, and after a long days work I come home to boating and jet skiing on the lake. </p>
			<h2>	Future goals
			</h2>
			<p> I plan on owning and operating my own place of business. I have yet to find something I'm particularly passionate about, I just know I need to be my own boss. I plan on living in the southern part of the state of Maine, and working out of that area as well. Business is in the future though, that is for certain! </p>
